🔐 Authentication & Authorization Microservice

A secure, scalable authentication microservice designed to serve as a centralized auth provider for distributed systems and microservice architectures.

Built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and Prisma, this service provides JWT-based authentication, a role-permission access control system, and robust CI/CD pipelines for production-grade deployment.

🚀 Features

✅ JWT-based Auth Flow — Access & refresh token strategy with auto-refresh support

🧩 Role & Permission Model — Hierarchical RBAC (Roles → Permissions) with middleware guards

🧠 Type-safe ORM — Powered by Prisma for schema management and database migrations

🐳 Dockerized Setup — Fully containerized for local development and production environments

📘 OpenAPI / Swagger Docs — Auto-generated API documentation for easy integration

🧪 Comprehensive Testing — Unit & integration tests using Jest + Supertest

🔄 CI/CD Ready — GitHub Actions workflow for linting, testing, building, and migrations

🧰 Extensible Architecture — Easily integrable with other microservices (e.g., user, billing, OTA)
